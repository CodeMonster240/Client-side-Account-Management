# Client-side-Account-Management
A completely client side account creation and management system. This uses localStorage to save passwords and stuff.

DO NOT USE YOUR ACTUAL EMAIL AND PASSWORDS. LOCALSTROAGE IS EASILY COMPROMISABLE AND IF YOU USE ACTUAL STUFF THEN IT MIGHT BE STOLEN!!!!!!!!!!

# USAGE

To use this, then you must have nodejs installed. Running this on the File:// protocol works, but running it on an http server works better.
I won't give you a tutorial on how to make an http server because using this requires basic server knowledge!
